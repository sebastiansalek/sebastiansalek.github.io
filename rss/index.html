It is, first of all, a cool, elegant piece of work—not surprising, given Apple’s distinguished history of television propaganda. Salonen is shown receiving inspiration for a passage in his Violin Concerto and trying it out in his iPad; then, after a montage of scenes in London and Finland, we see the violinist Leila Josefowicz and the Philharmonia Orchestra, of London, digging in to the score. More notably, it is musical: the concerto dictates the rhythm of the editing, and the correlation between notation and sound is made excitingly clear. Most unusually, it celebrates a contemporary classical piece; Salonen’s concerto had its première at the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 2009 (my review is here).</p>

<p>Salonen’s enthusiasm for Apple products is genuine. When I wrote a Profile of him, in 2007, I began with an extended scene at the Santa Monica Apple Store, where he demontrated how he used various kinds of software to compose. He is now being rewarded with an extraordinarily powerful platform: in less than a day, the ad racked up a hundred thousand views on YouTube, and there is an auxiliary page of videos on the Apple Web site, including a free recording of the entire concerto, made for this occasion. One can’t help thinking of the hundreds of gifted composers who are not so fortunate—there is no job as solitary and invisible as writing music for a living. The very phrase “classical music,” implying an art devoted exclusively to the past, banishes it into limbo. But I imagine that many composers will be pleased at the sight of Salonen’s mass-market breakthrough. Very simply, it says: We exist.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/test-post-new-yorker/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5c100624-0c0f-4ed7-9dd6-4fdb01f07cbf</guid><category><![CDATA[music]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sebastian Salek]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2014 19:57:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Best Way to Link Your Tweets Together]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Let's face it, sometimes 140 characters just isn't enough.</p>

<p>Some clever people have capitalised on that gripe, launching services like <a href='http://www.twitlonger.com/' >TwitLonger</a> and <a href='http://www.storify.com/' >Storify</a>. However, sometimes we just want our followers to know that what we're posting is part of a longer message spanning multiple tweets.</p>

<p>This is most commonly done in two ways:</p>

<h2 id="1numbering">1) Numbering  </h2>

<p>This method isn't ideal because it takes up characters and orders the tweets in reverse order.</p>

<h2 id="2typingquicklyandhopingforthebest">2) Typing quickly and hoping for the best  </h2>

<p>This method will split your tweets up on some people's timelines (if someone else they follow tweets between them) and so they'll be meaningless out of context. Even if they don't, the message string will be displayed chronologically, so people will end up reading your last message first.</p>

<h2 id="3thethirdoption">3) The third option  </h2>

<p>There's actually a third option that's better than both of these methods, and it involves those pesky blue lines you all hated at first but have now forgotten about.</p>

<p>Post your first tweet, then as you go to type the second, <em>reply to the previous one</em>. Even if you delete your handle (which is recommended), blue lines will appear linking them together.</p>

<p>This saves you characters as you don't have to include numbering or ellipses, it keeps the tweets linked on your followers' timelines no matter how far apart you tweet, and it displays them in the right order to be read.</p>

<p><strong>Happy tweeting!</strong></p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/the-best-way-to-link-your-tweets-together/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">2549c17f-a701-4e66-af3b-8d39e249443c</guid><category><![CDATA[startups]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sebastian Salek]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 11:48:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Test startups post]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is only a test.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/test-startups-post/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">bcd4d2da-b3dd-434c-bcfe-43239b6eade1</guid><category><![CDATA[startups]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sebastian Salek]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 08:31:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[10 Reasons Why I Self-Funded My Startup and So Should You]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This isn't a post to promote my company. <br />
I'm not even going to mention it by name. <br />
This isn't a post to promote some magical get-rich-quick scheme. There is no such thing. <br />
This post is simply here to remind some of you why we do what we do. A message that often gets lost, <br />
in this world of funding-hungry startups.</p>

<p><strong>8 months ago I started my company.</strong></p>

<p>It had one employee (me), zero revenue and no product.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to the present day and I now have a profitable software product with hundreds of customers paying a monthly subscription, revenue is growing month on month, and there's enough cash flow to comfortably pay myself and 3 staff.</p>

<p>And I never took a cent of outside funding.</p>

<p>Here's why I think self-funding (also known as bootstrapping) is the best thing a young startup can do.</p>

<h2 id="1youareforcedtofocusonrevenue">1. You are forced to focus on revenue</h2>

<p>You don't have a fat chunk of funding in the company bank account providing a year or more of runway. You only have a meager personal cash injection from your own savings, giving maybe 6 months of runway if you forgo luxuries such as eating.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/this-is-a-test/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">99fc95f8-2e71-449a-a023-e5f13d43d66a</guid><category><![CDATA[startups]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sebastian Salek]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2014 20:27:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Woo, you're live! Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
<li>Drink the milk  </li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like <a href='http://ghost.org/' >http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href='http://ghost.org/' >the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src='https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png'  alt="The Ghost Logo" /></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!" /></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/welcome-to-ghost/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">09aa3157-1663-4f6f-8088-2889abc055ed</guid><category><![CDATA[music]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sebastian Salek]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2014 13:47:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
